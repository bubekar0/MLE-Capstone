## Motivation
This project was chosen mainly for two reasons. First, because it tackles a real-life problem, the task of designing a targeted advertising campaign based on data from known customers, more specifically, based on how the customers differ from the general population at large. Second, because it uniquely combines a number of Machine Learning Engineering techniques covered during the course, namely, dimensionality reduction, segmentation (clustering), and classification. The combination of
a task that can be easily generalized to a wide scope of applications, together with the multiplicity of moving parts involved in this project, makes for a rich experience for someone who is getting started with Data Science in general, and Machine Learning in particular. As an added bonus, this project offers a substantial opportunity to learn or practice Data Exploration and Processing techniques. The amount of missing data, the disparity with wich such data gaps appear, the high level of correlated features, the subtly hidden outliers, and the combination of numerical with categorical data, makes for an experience in data wrangling that is truly second to none.

More concretely, the project consists of analyzing demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population of that country. Aside from the customer and general population datasets, a separate pair of datasets was made available for training and testing a classifier; these datasets were obtained from a recent mailout campaign and have the same type of data features and quality.

The sequential flow of the project is as follows: First, the customer and general population data is preprocessed and prepared to be used in unsupervised learning to perform customer segmentation in order to spot customers in the population, or rather, in order to identify which features of the data find overrepresentation with customers, and which are underrepresented. Then, the datasets of the recent marketing campaign are used to model and to predict which individuals are most likely to become customers for the company. Finally, the predictions are tested and scored in a kaggle competition.
